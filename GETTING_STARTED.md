# 🎉 Next Steps - Getting Started with Runtime Guard Deployment

Congratulations! You now have a complete automation platform for deploying runtime guard wrapper contracts to Soroban testnet. Here's what you can do next:

## 📋 Getting Started Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Today)

- [ ] **Read Quick Start**
  - File: [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)
  - Time: 5 minutes
  - Learn the basics and deploy your first contract

- [ ] **Set Up Environment**
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env.local
  nano .env.local  # Add SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY
  ```

- [ ] **Test Dry Run**
  ```bash
  chmod +x scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh
  ./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --dry-run --debug
  ```

### Tomorrow - Deploy & Verify

- [ ] **Deploy to Testnet**
  ```bash
  source .env.local
  ./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --network testnet
  ```

- [ ] **Verify Deployment**
  ```bash
  cat .deployment-manifest.json | jq '.'
  tail -50 .deployment.log
  ```

- [ ] **Check Contract Health**
  ```bash
  CONTRACT_ID=$(jq -r '.deployments[0].contract_id' .deployment-manifest.json)
  soroban contract invoke \
      --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
      --network testnet \
      -- health_check
  ```

### This Week - CI/CD Setup (Optional)

- [ ] **Add GitHub Secret**
  ```bash
  gh secret set SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY --body "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
  ```

- [ ] **Test GitHub Actions**
  - Go to Actions tab
  - Select "Soroban Runtime Guard Deployment"
  - Click "Run workflow"
  - Monitor the run

- [ ] **Review Deployment Artifacts**
  - Download `deployment-manifest-*`
  - Download `deployment-log-*`
  - Verify successful deployment

### This Month - Production Setup

- [ ] **Review Full Documentation**
  - [SOROBAN_DEPLOYMENT.md](SOROBAN_DEPLOYMENT.md) - Complete guide
  - [docs/ci-cd-setup.md](docs/ci-cd-setup.md) - CI/CD configuration
  - [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design

- [ ] **Configure Branch Protection**
  - Settings > Branches > Add rule

## 🚀 Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Testnet Deployment
**Goal:** Deploy once, validate

```bash
# Setup (one time)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local

# Deploy
source .env.local
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --network testnet

# Done! Contract deployed and validated
```

### Scenario 2: Automated CI/CD
**Goal:** Auto-deploy on every push to main

```bash
# Setup (one time)
gh secret set SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY --body "YOUR_KEY"

# Now automatic:
# - Any push to main → GitHub Actions runs
# - Builds, deploys, validates automatically
# - Every 6 hours: continuous validation
```

### Scenario 3: Development & Testing
**Goal:** Frequent test deployments

```bash
# Use dry-run first
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --dry-run

# Deploy for testing
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --network testnet

# Iterate quickly
# Modify contract → test → redeploy
```

### Scenario 4: Production Validation
**Goal:** Continuous monitoring

```bash
# Deploy with monitoring
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --network testnet

# Script runs continuously
# Validates every 5 minutes
# Updates .deployment-manifest.json
```

## 🔧 Common Commands Reference

### Deployment
```bash
# Full deployment with validation
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --network testnet

# Dry run (no actual deployment)
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --dry-run

# Without continuous validation
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --no-continuous

# Custom validation interval
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --interval 600

# Debug mode
./scripts/deploy-soroban-testnet.sh --debug
```

### Verification
```bash
# Get deployed contract ID
jq -r '.deployments[0].contract_id' .deployment-manifest.json

# Health check
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network testnet -- health_check

# Get stats
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network testnet -- get_stats

# Watch logs
tail -f .deployment.log

# Latest deployment summary
head -20 .deployment.log
```

### GitHub Actions
```bash
# List recent runs
gh run list --workflow soroban-deploy.yml --limit 10

# View specific run
gh run view <RUN_ID>

# Download artifacts
gh run download <RUN_ID> -n deployment-manifest-<RUN_ID>
```
